- ## Follow through the steps:
    - First clone the repo by pasting ``` git clone https://github.com/rosekamallove/CodingSetup ~ ```
    - Then paste this command in the terminal ``` alias letscode="sh ~/CodingSetup/createTemp.sh ```
    - Now all you have to do to start coding is type in ``` letscode $name ``` .
        - It will create a folder of the name you provided.
        - And in that folder it will create three files, 
            - ``` input.txt ``` 
            - ``` output.txt ``` 
            - ```code.cpp```
            - And then open VSCode in this folder by running ``` code . ``` which you can change in the ```createTemp.sh``` file
        - The ```code.cpp``` contains the template which I wrote that you can edit at ``` ~/CodingSetup/template.cpp```
        - The code after running will take input form ```input.txt``` and write the ouput in ```output.txt```.
